# odin-recipes

Set up your README.md file and write a brief introduction describing what the current project is and what skills you will have demonstrated once you have completed it. (You can also do this as a self-reflection at the end of the project, which is a good way to review what you have learned.)

This project is a basic recipe website in order to apply basic HTML skills like building a boiler plate, links, lists, and images.

By completing this project, I have demonstrated basic bare bones ability to understand HTML structure and visualize the framework of a site for placement of elements.  I have learned very simply how to use Git as version control and work with pushing to GitHub.
