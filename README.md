# 🍽️ Odin Recipes Project

## 👋 Introduction

Welcome to my very first project on GitHub!  
This project is part of **The Odin Project's** Foundation curriculum, designed to help me learn and apply fundamental skills in **HTML**. It's a basic recipe website — and my first step into the world of web development!


## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

I used the following tools and technologies to complete this project:

- 🧱 **HTML5**
- 💻 **Visual Studio Code** (VSC)
- 🐧 **WSL2 (Ubuntu)** via Terminal
- 🌐 **Git** & **GitHub** for version control


## 🎯 Objectives

The main goals of this project were to:

- Create a basic recipe website using pure HTML.
- Build 4 HTML pages:  
  📄 1 index page  
  🍜 3+ individual recipe pages  
- Practice core HTML features:
  - Boilerplate structure
  - Paragraphs, headings, and lists
  - Images and links
- Get comfortable with using Git from the command line and pushing to GitHub.


## 🚀 What I Learned

By completing this project, I gained:

- A strong foundation in writing and structuring HTML
- An understanding of how to link between pages
- Confidence using Git for version control
- The ability to deploy a basic site using GitHub Pages
